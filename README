MultiUN: Multilingual UN Parallel Text  Release v1
March 20, 2010
===================================

This corpus was collected from the United Nations Website
(http://www.ods.un.org/ods/), and then cleaned and converted 
to XML at Language Technology Lab in DFKI GmbH (LT-DFKI), Germany. 
The documents were published by UN from 2000 to 2010.

More information can be found at
	http://www.euromatrixplus.eu

The corpus contains 463,406 XML documents, consisting of around
300M tokens per language. The documents were extracted from the UN 
web site by a specially designed crawler. The documents extracted 
were in MS Word format. They were converted to plain text at LT-DFKI. 
All documents are encoded in UTF-8 encoding. 

We reserved the most recent documents (ca. 6 months) for testing 
and comparisons, which is going to be included in the training 
set in the next update. 


Format
----------------

The sentences in the documents have been split, wrapped with 
"<s n="i">...</s>" tags, while the paragraph boundaries are 
reserved with "<p n="j">...</p>" tags, in which i, j are natural
numbers.

In addition, the documents include the following information:
-a file ID, which is unique for each individual file,
-the language with which the document is labeled in the ODS,
-the publication date of the document,
-a document symbol, an identifier assigned for a United Nations document.

Each file is named after the abbreviation of its document symbol
and its language. That is, files of the same document in different 
languages have file names with the same prefix. For instance, the 
files named  "S_AGENDA_5874-ru.xml" and "S_AGENDA_5874-en.xml" are 
Russian and English version of the same document with a document 
symbol "S/AGENDA/5874" respectively.


Plain text extractor
----------------

You can extract any parallel files with the command

	python ./extract.py L1 L2 L3 ....

where L1, L2 and L3, etc. can be any/all of the 7 languages
	ar de en es fr ru zh 

The output is stored in the text/ directory. Each file contains
plain texts extracted from one XML document, one sentence per 
line. Paragraph boundaries are preserved by empty lines. Parallel
files have the same file prefix, whereas the suffixes correspond
to the languages. For example, the following files are Spanish
and Chinese texts of the same document.

        ./text/es-zh/2009/UNEP_POPS_POPRC5_3_es.snt
        ./text/es-zh/2009/UNEP_POPS_POPRC5_3_zh.snt

NOTE: To use this corpus for building SMT systems, you want to
- tokenize words and punctuation (recommended)
- sentence alignment (required)
- lowercase the text (recommended)
- strip empty lines and their correspondences (recommended)
